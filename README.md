Homework 1:

1) Task 1
   Create simple java class with main method that prints some text.
   Parse array from main method arguments and print its first element.
   Compile and run your class from command line.

2) Task 2
   You have array of numbers [3, 7, 6, 13, 33, 9, -100, 25]
   Print all the values of array using while loop.
   In the same loop find the biggest and the smallest value of an array and then print values afterwards.

3) Task 3
   You have array of numbers [3, 7, 6, 13, 33, 9, -100, 25]
   Sort this array using one of sorting algorithms: Insertion sort, Selection sort, Bubble sort.
   You need to understand idea of each this method but use only one for implementation.

Selection sort:
Repeatedly finds the smallest element in an unsorted array and moves it to the front of the array.
The element swaps positions with the current element at the first position of the unsorted portion of the array.

Homework 2:
I. Create a classes hierarchy. It should include at least 10 classes
Topic: Library(Try to find a books or any other information for person based on their preferences)

II. Override methods from class Object(toString, hashcode, equals) for at least 3 classes from the hierarchy.

Homework 3:
Add to your hierarchies:

- Use polymorphism with the abstract class from the hierarchy.
- Create final class, method, variable.

Homework 4:

- Add 5 interfaces to the existing hierarchy.
- Use polymorphism with an interface from the hierarchy.
- Create a static block, method, variable.

Homework 5:

Task 1: Extend your current classes hierarchy including next points:

- Create 5 custom exceptions.
- Handle exceptions in 2 ways: using throws and using try/catch

Task 2: Improve your current classes hierarchy including next points:

- Replace System.out.print() by “java.util.logging.Logger” usage.
- Use different log levels.
- Configure logging of messages to the console and file at the same time using Java logging configuration.
